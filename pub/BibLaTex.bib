@electronic{HazCan:2013,
	abstract = {While Canada is exposed to a variety of natural hazards, most risk and emergency managers presently lack the necessary tools and guidance to adequately undertake rigorous risk assessments. Recently, Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) has adopted Hazus, a standardized methodology for estimating potential losses from natural hazards developed by the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA, fema.gov/hazus) as one of the best practice methods for risk assessment. Hazus estimates potential losses from earthquakes, floods and hurricanes, and includes a hazard and inventory database needed to conduct baseline risk assessment studies. An agreement has been signed with FEMA to adapt and co-develop a harmonized North American version of the Hazus methodology. At the same time, collaboration has been initiated within the federal government between the departments of Natural Resources, Environment, Defence and Public Safety to promote widespread usage of Hazus among the full range of Canadian decision-makers. This article reports the typical features of the Canadian version of the Hazus flood module and summarizes ongoing activities and potential challenges in implementing this model in Canada. },
